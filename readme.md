JSON-P DB Redux is a minimal Google App Engine app to persist/retrieve JSON objects via simple client-side javascript JSON-P calls. Curl also supported.

JSON-P DB Redux is the resurrection, modification and extension of the abandoned <a href="http://jsonpdb.appspot.com/index.html">JSON-P DB</a> project by <a href="https://plus.google.com/+AdamRibaudo/posts">Adam Ribaudo</a> and <a href="https://plus.google.com/+PaulIrish/posts">Paul Irish</a>

This is good for having your own free and highly-hackable server to persist JSON objects from your web projects. Ready in 5 minutes.
